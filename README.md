# React Starter

This project is a React template that was not generated using `create-react-app`, rather it was written from scratch as a way for me to learn just wtf CRA is doing, and to make future projects easier to start. In my opinion CRA abstracts configuration away a little _too_ much. They don't make it easy to customize.

### Packages

This starter notably comes with `typescript`, `recoil`, `tailwindcss`, `react-router-dom`, and `jest`. Support is also included for css/sass/scss, subresource integrity, asset optimization, and path alias intellisense.
